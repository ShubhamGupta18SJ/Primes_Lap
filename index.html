          <p>The Smart Home is becoming more accessible and affordable thanks to Matter, a new protocol that allows
            devices from different manufacturers to interoperate. </p>
          <p>Matter has the potential to make Smart Homes more accessible to everyone, regardless of budget or technical
            expertise.</p><br>
          <p>Matter is a game-changer for the Smart Home market. It is making Smart Homes more democratic and inclusive,
            which will lead to wider adoption and innovation. Though it’s early days and still has a long way to go (you
            still cannot say “Hey Alexa, play Stranger Things on my Apple TV”), it's a great start.</p>

          <h3>Matter Security Vulnerability</h3>
          <p>Matter is designed to work best over a local area network (LAN). However, it inherits a key vulnerability
            from its predecessor: cloud-based service providers can access data and metadata on all Matter devices on
            your LAN when you remotely access your home. This could expose users to app tracking and ad pushing.
            Additionally, the reliance on app-specific Matter Controllers fragments the ecosystem further.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Privacy concerns are growing more paramount in consumer minds. Therefore, secure data transmission is
            required to eliminate cloud-based service provider access as information passes through their servers.
            Without addressing this security vulnerability, the Smart Home market may never reach its full potential.

        <h2>Primes Lab’s technology - Virtual Teleporter</h2>
        <p>Primes Lab's Virtual Teleporter™ is a disruptive Network Layer 3 technology that allows you to remotely
          connect your devices to a private LAN, just as if they were physically present on the network. The technology
          utilizes two VPN tunnels,<span>bypassing intermediary cloud servers and user registration</span> , to
          establish a peer-to-peer communication between your device and the private LAN. Deployment takes less than
          five minutes. Imagine accessing all your devices, files, and smart home gadgets at home
          <span>tracking-free</span> from anywhere in the world.</p>

        <p>Upon connecting to a private LAN through VPN, virtually teleported endpoint devices seamlessly integrate into the network. Intermediary cloud servers are unable to associate user physical entities with derivative actions, prohibiting meaningful tracking. This enables the realization of <span>P2P Remote Access</span>  (a VPN gateway plus a VMS server) and <span>Tracking-free App</span>  (a LAN-mode chat app), bypassing user registration and intermediary cloud servers, facilitating tracking-free peer-to-peer communication access and chat by remote endpoint devices from anywhere in the world.</p>
